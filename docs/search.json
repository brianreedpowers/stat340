    "text": "3.3 Aside: probability refresher\nBefore moving on, let’s briefly review some basic ideas from probability theory.\nWe have a set of possible outcomes, usually denoted \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nwhen we flip a coin, it can land either heads (\\(H\\)) or tails (\\(T\\)), so the outcomes are \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\).\nWhen we roll a six-sided die, there are six possible outcomes, \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\).\nIn other settings, the outcomes might be an infinite set.\n\nEx: if we measure the depth of Lake Mendota, the outcome may be any positive real number (at least theoretically, anyway!)\n\n\nIn the vast majority of situations, \\(\\Omega\\) will be either discrete (e.g., \\(\\{1,2,\\dots\\}\\)) or continuous (e.g., \\([0,1]\\)) and we call the associated random variable discrete or continuous, respectively.\nA subset \\(E \\subseteq \\Omega\\) of the outcome space is called an event.\nA probability is a function that maps events to numbers, with the properties that\n\n\\(\\Pr[ E ] \\in [0,1]\\) for all events \\(E\\)\n\\(\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = 1\\)\nFor \\(E_1,E_2 \\subseteq \\Omega\\) with \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\), \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cup E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] + \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\)\n\nTwo events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are independent if \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\).\nTwo random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if for all sets \\(S_1,S_2\\), we have \\(\\Pr[ X \\in S_1 ~\\&~ Y \\in S_2 ] = \\Pr[ X \\in S_1 ] \\Pr[ Y \\in S_2 ]\\).\nRoughly speaking, two random variables are independent if learning information about one of them doesn’t tell you anything about the other.\n\nFor example, if each of us flips a coin, it is reasonable to model them as being independent.\nLearning whether my coin landed heads or tails doesn’t tell us anything about your coin.\n\nExample: Coin flipping\nConsider a coin toss, in which the possible outcomes are \\(\\Omega = \\{ H, T \\}\\).\nThis is a discrete random experiment, but beause the outcomes are not numeric it is not a random variable. If, however we define \\(X\\) to be 1 when we flip an \\(H\\) and 0 when we flip \\(T\\), then we have defined a discrete random variable, because the outcome set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) is discrete.\nIf we have a fair coin, then it is sensible that \\(\\Pr[ X=1 ] = \\Pr[ X=0 ] = 1/2\\).\nExercise (optional): verify that this probability satisfies the above properties!\nWe will see in a moment that this is a special case of a Bernoulli random variable, which you are probably already familiar with.\nExample: Six-sided die\nIf we roll a die, the outcome space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), and the events are all the subsets of this six-element set.\nSo, for example, we can talk about the event that we roll an odd number \\(E_{\\text{odd}} = \\{1,3,5\\}\\) or the event that we roll a number larger than \\(4\\), \\(E_{&gt;4} = \\{5,6\\}\\).\nExample: Human heights\nConsider our human height example from our previous lecture.\nWe pick a random person and measure their height in, say, centimeters. What is the outcome space?\n\nOne option: the outcome space is the set of positive reals, in which case this is a continuous random variable.\nAlternatively, we could assume that the outcome space is the set of all real numbers.\n\nThis highlights the importance of specifying our assumptions and the outcome space we are working with in a particular problem. We will see these kinds of issues again and again this semester.\n\n3.3.1 A note on models, assumptions and approximations\nNote that we are already making an approximation– our outcome sets aren’t really exhaustive, here.\nWhen you toss a coin, there are possible outcomes other than heads and tails.\n\nPerhaps the coin lands on its side (I have personally seen this happen with a nickel flipped onto an old wooden floor).\nSimilarly, perhaps the die lands on its side.\n\nWe can see a kind of idealization in our human height example.\n\nWe can only measure a height to some finite precision (say, two decimal places), so it is a bit silly to take the outcome space to be the real numbers.\nAfter all, if we can only measure a height to two decimal places, then there is no way to ever obtain the event, “height is 160.3333333… centimeters”.\n\nThese kinds of approximations and idealizations are good to be aware of, but they usually don’t bother us much\nWe will see below and in future lectures the kinds of approximation errors that are more concerning and warrant our attention."

    "text": "3.4 Random variables\nA random variable is specified by a probability.\nThat is, a random variable \\(X\\) is specified by an outcome set \\(\\Omega\\) and a function that specifies probabilities of the form \\(\\Pr[ X \\in E ]\\) where \\(E \\subseteq \\Omega\\) is an event.\nLet’s look at some commonly-used random variables. In the process, we will discuss some of the real-world phenomena to which these random variables are best-suited.\n\n3.4.1 Bernoulli\nA Bernoulli random variable has outcome set \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1\\}\\).\nAs discussed above, to specify a probability on this set, it is enough for us to specify \\(\\Pr[ \\{0 \\} ]\\) and \\(\\Pr[ \\{1\\} ]\\).\nTypically, we do this by specifying the success probability \\(p = \\Pr[ \\{1\\} ] \\in [0,1]\\). Once we have done this, it is immediate that (check!) \\(\\Pr[ \\{0\\} ] = 1-p\\).\nNote that we can check that this gives us a probability by verifying that it sums to 1: \\[\n\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = \\Pr[ \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\} ] = \\Pr[ \\{0\\} ] + \\Pr[ \\{1\\} ] = 1-p + p = 1.\n\\] Bernoulli random variables are commonly used to model “yes or no” events. That is, events of the form “whether or not event \\(A\\) happens”. Common examples:\n\nCoin flips\nwhether or not a person gets sick with a disease\nwhether or not a team wins a game.\n\nIf \\(Z\\) is a Bernoulli random variable with probability of success \\(p\\), then we write \\(Z \\sim \\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)\\).\nWe read this as something like “\\(Z\\) is distributed as Bernoulli \\(p\\)”.\n\n\n3.4.2 Binomial\nA Bernoulli random variable is like a single coin flip.\nWhat if we flip many coins, all with the same probability of coming up heads?\nThen the total number of heads is distributed as a binomial random variable.\nIn particular, we describe a binomial distribution by specifying two parameters:\n\nthe number of trials (i.e., coins flipped) \\(n\\), often called the size parameter and\nthe success probability \\(p\\) (i.e., the probability that an individual coin lands heads).\n\nOften we will write \\(\\operatorname{Binomial}(n,p)\\) to denote this distribution.\nSo if \\(X\\) is a Binomial random variable with \\(n\\) trials and success probability \\(p\\), we write \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Binomial}(n,p)\\).\nExample: modeling COVID-19\nIn a population of 250,000 people (approximately the population of Madison), we may imagine that each person has some probability \\(p\\) of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.\nThen, in a sense, the total number of people in Madison who become seriously ill with COVID-19 is like the total number of probability-\\(p\\) coin flips that land heads when we flip \\(250,000\\) coins.\nWe might then model the number of COVID-19 patients by a binomial random variable with \\(n=250,000\\) and \\(p=0.01\\) (just to be clear, we are completely making up this choice of \\(p\\) here, just for the sake of example!).\n\n3.4.2.1 Generating random binomial RVs\nWe can generate binomial random variables using the rbinom function. Think “r for random”.\n\n# rbinom takes three arguments.\n# The first is the number of random variables we want to generate (confusingly, this is called n in the R docs).\n# The size argument specifies the number of coins to flip, i.e., n in our notation above (I know! Confusing!)\n# The prob argument specifies the probability that one coin lands heads, i.e., p in our notation above.\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3) # produces a random number from {0,1,2,...,10}, with 2,3,4 being most common (because np = 3 is the expected value we'll come back to this!)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# If we repeat the experiment a few times, we get different random values.\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3)\n\n[1] 4\n\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3)\n\n[1] 4\n\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3)\n\n[1] 4\n\nrbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.3)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nWe can also use the binomial to generate Bernoulli random variables, by setting the size argument to 1 (i.e., flip 1 coin):\n\nrbinom(1, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # 1 is \"heads\", 0 is \"tails\"\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nImportant note: if you read the R documentation, there is a possible notational confusion waiting for you, alluded to in the comments of the code above. The signature of the rbinom function is given as rbinom(n, size, prob). Based on the \\(\\operatorname{Binomial}(n,p)\\) notation we used above, you might expect that n in the rbinom function is the number of coins and prob is the success probability. Unfortunately, that isn’t quite right. n is the number of Binomial random variables to generate. size specifies the size parameter (\\(n\\) in our math notation above).\nCompare the following:\n\nrbinom(n = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # 3 draws from a Binomial(10,0.5)\n\n[1] 8 7 4\n\n\n\nrbinom(n = 10, size = 3, prob = 0.5) # 10 draws from a Binomial(3,0.5)\n\n [1] 0 0 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 2\n\n\nAll of the R functions for generating random variables take n as the number of draws from the distribution. This is in keeping with the convention in most of probability and statistics that \\(n\\) is a sample size. Unfortunately, this is just one of those places where two different notational conventions collide. It’s unfortunate that it arises in such a common and early-stage part of R!\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Aside: expectation review\nBefore we continue with more random variables, let’s take a pause to discuss one more important probability concept: expectation. You will hopefully recall from previous courses in probability and/or statistics the notion of expectation of a random variable.\nExpectation: long-run averages\nThe expectation of a random variable \\(X\\), which we write \\(\\mathbb{E} X\\), is the “long-run average” of the random variable.\nRoughly speaking, the expectation is what we would see on average if we observed many copies of \\(X\\).\nThat is, we observe \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n\\), and consider their average, \\(\\bar{X} = n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\).\nThe law of large numbers (LLN) states that in a certain sense, as \\(n\\) gets large, \\(\\bar{X}\\) gets very close to \\(\\mathbb{E} X\\). (actually, there are two LLNs, the weak law and strong law, but that’s a matter for a later course!).\nBy analogy with our calculus class, we would like to say something like \\[\n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \\mathbb{E} X.\n\\] But \\(n^{-1} \\sum_i X_i\\) is a random sum, so how can we take a limit?\nWell, again, the details are a matter for your probability theory class, but roughly speaking, for \\(n\\) large, with high probability, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is close to \\(\\mathbb{E}\\).\nExpectation: formal definition\nMore formally, if \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable, we define its expectation \\(\\mu\\) to be \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\sum_k k \\Pr[ X = k]\n\\] where the sum is over all \\(k\\) such that \\(\\Pr[ X=k ] &gt; 0\\).\n\nNote that this set could be finite or infinite.\nIf the set is infinite, the sum might not converge, in which case we say that the expectation is either infinite or doesn’t exist. But that won’t be an issue this semester.\n\nQuestion: can you see how this definition is indeed like the “average behavior” of \\(X\\)?\nExercise: compute the expectation of a Bernoulli random variable with success probability \\(p\\). What about a \\(\\operatorname{Binomial}(n,p)\\) random variable? Hint: the expectation of a sum of RVs is the sum of their expectations. Write the Binomial RV as a sum of Bernoullis.\nImportant take-away: the law of large numbers says that if we take the average of a bunch of independent RVs, the average will be close to the expected value.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to compute the expected value exactly (e.g., because the math is hard– not all sums are nice!)\nThis is where Monte Carlo methods come in– instead of trying to compute the expectation exactly, we just generate lots of RVs and take their average!\nIf we generate enough RVs, the LLN says we can get as close as we want.\nWe’ll have lots to say about this in our lectures on Monte Carlo methods next week.\n\nVariance: formal definition\nAlso recall the variance is the expectation of the squared deviation from the mean, i.e: \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X)=\\mathbb{E}[(X-\\mathbb{E}X)^2]=\\sum_k (k-\\mu)^2 \\Pr[ X = k]\n\\] Similar to how the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) converges to \\(\\mathbb{E}X\\), the sample variance \\(s^2\\) will converge to the true variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), i.e: \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac1{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2=\\operatorname{Var}(X)\n\\]\n\n\n3.4.4 Geometric\nLet’s consider a different coin-flipping experiment. We flip a coin repeatedly and we count how many flips it takes before it lands heads.\nSo perhaps we flip the coin and it comes up heads immediately, in which case we would count zero (because there were no flips before the one where the coin landed heads). If we flipped the coin and it came up heads for the first time on the fourth toss, then we would count three, and so on.\nThis game describes the geometric distribution.\nIts behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the probability \\(p\\) of landing heads.\nThe geometric distribution is a natural model for “time to failure” experiments.\nFor example, suppose we install a light bulb, and measure how many days until the lightbulb burns out (one such experiment has been ongoing for a very long time!.\nWe can generate random geometric random variables using the rgeom function:\n\nrgeom(1, prob = 0.5) # Generate one geometric random variable with p=0.5. Most likely outcomes: 0,1,2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe probability that a \\(\\operatorname{Geom}(p)\\) random variable \\(X\\) takes a particular value \\(k\\) (\\(k=0,1,2,\\dots\\)) is given by \\(\\Pr[ X = k ] = (1-p)^k p.\\)\nThis is the probability mass function of the geometric distribution. It assigns, to each singleton in the outcome space, a nonnegative number (i.e., its probability), and it does so in such a way that these nonnegative numbers sum to 1 (this ensures that these numbers do indeed specify a probability distribution!). Some texts will refer to this function as a distribution function, but I will avoid it in our notes and lectures, because there is possibility of confusion with other related terms (e.g., the cumulative distribution function, which we’ll see soon).\nLet’s plot this as a function of \\(k\\):\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nk &lt;- seq(0, 15)\np &lt;- 0.3\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\"k\" = k, \"Probk\" = p * (1 - p)^k)\npp &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = Probk)) +\n  geom_col()\npp\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot, we see that the geometric distribution puts most of its probability close to zero– the most likely outcomes are 0, then 1, then 2, and so on.\nWe plotted the distribution only up to \\(k=15\\), but a geometric random variable can, technically, take any non-negative integer as a value.\nFor any value of \\(k\\), \\(\\\\Pr[ X = k ] = p(1-p)^k\\) is non-zero (as long as \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\)).\nSo for any non-negative integer, there is a small but non-zero probability that a geometric random variable takes that integer as a value.\nWe say that the geometric random variable has infinite support.\nThe support of a discrete random variable is the set of values that have non-zero probability mass. A random variable has infinite support if this set is infinite.\nExercise: verify that this is a bona fide probability by checking that \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty p(1-p)^k = 1\\).\nNote: some resources follow a slightly different convention, whereby a geometric random variable counts the total number of attempts (i.e., coinflips) before success, so the support is \\(\\{1,2,\\dots\\}\\). Our discussion above follows the convention of most textbooks and research papers (and the convention followed by R– see ?rgeom), but this is an important thing to be aware of!\n\n\n3.4.5 Poisson\nLet’s look at one more discrete distribution.\nSuppose we are going fishing on lake Mendota, and we want to model how many fish we catch in an hour.\nA common choice for this situation is the Poisson distribution (named after a French mathematician named Poisson, but “poisson” is also French for “fish”).\nThe Poisson distribution is a common choice for modeling “arrivals” or other events that happen per unit time. Common examples include\n\ncustomers arriving to a store on a given day\ncalls to a phone line between 2pm and 3pm\nphotons or other particles hitting a detector during an experiment\ncars arriving at an intersection\n\nThe Poisson distribution has probability mass function \\[\n\\Pr[ X=k ] = \\frac{ \\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda} }{ k! }, ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ k=0,1,2,\\dots\n\\] The parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), often called the “rate parameter”, controls the average behavior of the random variable– larger choices of \\(\\lambda\\) mean that the resulting random variable is larger, on average (we will make this statement more precise in a few lectures). That is, the larger \\(\\lambda\\) is, the more arrivals happen per unit time– the larger \\(\\lambda\\) is, the higher the rate!\nWe can generate Poisson random variables using rpois:\n\nrpois(1, lambda = 10.5) # Generate Poisson RV with lambda=10.5 most likely value is 10.\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nWhat if I want several random Poissons, instead of just one?\nThe n argument to rpois (and all the other random variable generation functions) specifies a number of variables to generate.\nSo, for example, to get ten random Poissons, we can write\n\nrpois(10, lambda = 10.5) # Generate 10 Poisson RVs with the same parameter lambda=10.5\n\n [1] 13 16 11  9 11 15 11  8 15  9\n\n\nWhat does the probability mass function of the Poisson look like? Once again, the Poisson distribution has infinite support, since \\(\\Pr[X=k] &gt; 0\\) for all \\(k=0,1,2,\\dots\\) (check this!), but let’s plot its first few values.\n\nk &lt;- seq(0, 30)\nlambda &lt;- 10.5 # On average, we should get back the value 10.5,\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\"k\" = k, \"Probk\" = dpois(k, lambda))\npp &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = Probk)) +\n  geom_col()\npp\n\n\n\n\nThe function dpois above evaluates the Poisson probability mass function.\nThe R documentation calls this a density, which is correct, but… well, we will return to this.\nFor now, just remember “r for random”, “d for density”. rpois generates random Poisson variables, dpois evaluates its probability mass function.\n\n\n3.4.6 The Discrete uniform\nThe roll of a fair 6 sided die (or any \\(n\\)-sided die) can be modeled using a discrete uniform random variable. We will more often refer to the continuous uniform random variable, (which we’ll talk about shortly), but it’s worth mentioning that the roll of a die can be modeled easily.\nIn R, however, the discrete uniform is not a named distribution. Instead we would use the sample function. For example, suppose we wanted to simulate rolling a 6-sided die 100 times.\n\n# The sample function takes 3 important parameters.\n# x :      this can either be a vector of values to sample from\n#         or in this case simply the upper limit R will automatically\n#         create a vector from 1 to this value to sample from\n# size :   how many samples to generate\n# replace: this indicates whether we are able to re-sample the same value\n#         more than once. Careful, the default value is FALSE\nrolls &lt;- sample(x = 6, size = 100, replace = TRUE)\nrolls\n\n  [1] 5 3 6 1 1 6 2 3 1 6 3 2 1 1 4 6 5 6 5 1 6 5 2 1 5 5 5 3 5 6 1 5 5 4 4 4 1\n [38] 3 3 2 6 4 2 5 5 5 1 5 4 4 2 1 6 3 5 3 5 3 5 2 3 3 5 1 3 1 1 2 3 4 4 2 2 5\n [75] 3 1 1 3 4 3 1 1 1 4 1 3 2 6 2 2 2 6 3 2 2 2 3 2 6 4\n\n\n\n\n3.4.7 Aside: approximating one random variable with another\nInterestingly, we can obtain the Poisson distribution from the binomial distribution.\nLet’s make two assumptions about our fish population:\n\nThere are many fish in the lake. Let’s call the number of fish \\(N\\), which is a large number.\nFor each fish, there is a small probability \\(p\\) that we catch it (the same probability for each fish, for the sake of simplicity)\n\nIf we let \\(N\\) get arbitrarily large (“infinite” a limit like you remember from calculus) while \\(p\\) stays “small”, the Binomial distribution comes to be equal to the Poisson distribution with rate \\(Np\\).\nFor this reason, the Poisson is often a good approximation to the Bernoulli when \\(N\\) is large and \\(p\\) is small.\nJust to illustrate, let’s plot the density of the binomial with \\(N\\) really large and \\(p\\) really small, but chosen so that \\(Np = 10.5\\) to match \\(\\lambda = 10.5\\) above.\n\nk &lt;- seq(0, 30)\nlambda &lt;- 10.5\nN &lt;- 1e6\np &lt;- lambda / N # On average, we should get back the value lambda\npoisprob &lt;- dpois(k, lambda) # Vector of Poisson probabilities\nbinomprob &lt;- dbinom(k, size = N, prob = p) # Binomial probs.\n# We need a column in our data frame encoding which of the two distributions a number comes from.\n# This isn't the only way to do this, but it is the easiest way to get things to play nice with the ggplot2 facet_wrap, which displays separate plots for different values in a particular column.\ndist &lt;- c(rep(\"Poisson\", length(k)), rep(\"Binom\", length(k)))\n\n# Construct our data frame.

    "text": "3.5 Continuous random variables\nSo far we’ve seen a few different discrete random variables. Their set of possible values are discrete sets like \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) or \\(\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}\\).\nThis is in contrast to continuous random variables, which take values in “continuous” sets like the interval \\([0,1]\\) or the real like \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nDiscrete random variables have probability mass functions, like \\(\\Pr[ X=k ] = p(1-p)^k\\), \\(k=0,1,2,\\dots\\).\nIn contrast, continuous random variables have probability density functions, which we will usually write as \\(f(x)\\) or \\(f(t)\\).\nThese random variables are a little trickier to think about at first, because it doesn’t make sense to ask about the probability that a continuous random variable takes a specific value. That is, \\(\\Pr[ X = k ]\\) doesn’t really make sense when \\(X\\) is continuous (actually– in a precise sense this does make sense, but the probability is always zero you’ll see why below).\nLet’s see some examples.\n\n3.5.1 Normal\nThe normal or Gaussian (after Carl Friedrich Gauss) random variable is undoubtedly the most fundamental in all of statistics.\nYou have likely heard of it before both in your previous courses and just… well, everywhere, in the form of the famous bell curve.\nThe normal distribution really is everywhere, and there are good reasons for this, which we will return to in a few lectures (see here for a preview).\nThe normal distribution is controlled by two parameters: a mean \\(\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and a variance \\(\\sigma^2 &gt; 0\\).\nThe standard normal has \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\), and it “looks like” this:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-4, 4, 0.1)\nf &lt;- dnorm(x, 0, 1) # eval density at x values, mean mu=0, standard deviation sigma=1.\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = x, \"density\" = f)\npp &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = density)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\npp\n\n\n\n\nThis is the probability density function of the standard normal. Of course, the curve extends out to infinity on the right and negative infinity on the left we just haven’t plotted it.\nHopefully this is a familiar shape to you. If not, no worries– you’ll see it plenty as you continue your studies.\nThis is a probability density, not a mass function, because to evaluate something like the probability that a normal random variable \\(X\\) falls between, say, \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), we have to integrate the area under this curve between these two endpoints.\nThis is why we refer to this as a density– recall from physics that integrating a density over a region (i.e., a volume) gives us a mass (compare to the discrete case, where we did call it a probability mass function).\nSaid another way, integrating the density over a region gives us the probability of that region. So if \\(X\\) is a normal random variable with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), \\[\n\\Pr[ -1 \\le X \\le 1 ] = \\int_{-1}^1 f(t; \\mu, \\sigma^2) dt,\n\\] where \\(f(t; \\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) is the density function of the normal distribution, \\[\nf(t;  \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ 2\\pi \\sigma^2 } } \\exp\\left\\{ \\frac{ -(t-\\mu)^2 }{ 2\\sigma^2 } \\right \\}.\n\\] The weird semicolon notation is to emphasize that the density is a function of \\(t\\), but its shape depends on \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThink of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) as two knobs we can twiddle to change the shape of the curve.\nChanging \\(\\mu\\) while keeping \\(\\sigma^2\\) fixed just shifts the distribution:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-6, 6, 0.1) # Some x values to evaluate at\nf1 &lt;- dnorm(x, -2, 1) # mean mu=-1, standard deviation sigma=1.\nf2 &lt;- dnorm(x, 0.5, 1) # mean mu=1.5, standard deviation sigma=1.\nf3 &lt;- dnorm(x, 1.5, 1) # mean mu=1.5, standard deviation sigma=1.\nmu &lt;- c(rep(-1, length(x)), rep(1.5, length(x)), rep(2.0, length(x)))\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = rep(x, 3), \"density\" = c(f1, f2, f3), \"mean\" = as.factor(mu))\npp &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = density, color = mean)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1)\npp\n\n\n\n\nChanging \\(\\sigma\\) changes the standard deviation (and hence also the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\)). Larger \\(\\sigma\\) means higher variance, which means a “wider” distribution:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-6, 6, 0.1) # Some x values to evaluate at\nf1 &lt;- dnorm(x, 0, 0.5) # mean 0, standard deviation sigma=1.\nf2 &lt;- dnorm(x, 0, 1) # mean 0, standard deviation sigma=2.\nf3 &lt;- dnorm(x, 0, 2) # mean 0, standard deviation sigma=3.\nsigma2 &lt;- c(rep(0.5, length(x)), rep(1, length(x)), rep(2, length(x)))\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = rep(x, 3), \"density\" = c(f1, f2, f3), \"variance\" = as.factor(sigma2))\npp &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = density, color = variance)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1)\npp\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll have plenty more to say about this later in the semester when we talk about fitting models to data. For now, think back to our human heights example from our introductory lecture– we played with the \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) parameters to find a normal distribution that “looked” a lot like our observed data.\nWe can generate normal random variables in R using the rnorm function:\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 1, sd = 2) # Note that we pass the standard deviation (sd), not the variance sigma^2.\n\n[1] -0.0311147\n\nrnorm(1) # If we don't specify a mean and sd, they default to 0 and 1, respectively\n\n[1] -0.9908474\n\n\nLet’s generate a bunch of normal RVs and plot their (normalized) histogram:\n\n# Reminder: if mu, sigma unspecified, they default to mu=0, sigma=1\ndata &lt;- rnorm(1e6) # 1e6 = 1.0x10^6 = one million standard normal RVs\npp &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(\"x\" = data), aes(x = data))\npp &lt;- pp + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.25, color = \"black\", fill = \"white\")\npp\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is a normalized histogram– it is scaled so that the areas of the rectangles sums to 1, like a probability distribution.\nNow, let’s overlay the normal density function on this.\n\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)\nf &lt;- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1) # Evaluating the density at points x\ndf_dnorm &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = x, \"f\" = f)\npp &lt;- pp + geom_line(data = df_dnorm, aes(x = x, y = f), size = 1, color = \"red\")\npp\n\n\n\n\nLook at how closely the histogram matches the density! This is no accident. The density describes the average-case behavior of the random variable.\nBecause we plotted a standard normal, one unit on the x-axis of the plot above is one standard deviation.\nYou will hopefully recall from any previous statistics courses that a normal random variable falls\n\nwithin one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., between -1 and 1 in the plot above) with probability about 0.68,\nwithin two standard deviations of the mean (i.e., between -2 and 2 in the plot above) with probability about 0.9545\nwithin three standard deviations of the mean (i.e., between -3 and 3 in the plot above) with probability about 0.997.\n\nWe can approximately check this by counting how many of our simulated normals fall in these ranges. What fraction of these data points fell within one standard deviation of the mean?\n\nsum(data &gt; -1 & data &lt; 1) / length(data) # Should be about 0.68\n\n[1] 0.682999\n\n\n\nsum(data &gt; -2 & data &lt; 2) / length(data) # should be about 0.9545\n\n[1] 0.954714\n\n\n\nsum(data &gt; -3 & data &lt; 3) / length(data) # should be about 0.997\n\n[1] 0.997312\n\n\nOf course, because the data is random, the proportions are not exactly equal to their predicted values, but they are quite close.\nThis is a nice illustration of the law of large numbers!\n\n3.5.1.1 Computing probabilities\nNow, let’s check this fact by using R to compute probabilities of the form \\(\\Pr[ a \\le X \\le b ]\\) for a normal RV \\(X\\), where \\(a \\ge b\\). How can we compute this probability?\nLet’s start by writing something slightly different: \\[\n\\Pr[ X \\le b ] = \\Pr[ X \\le a ] + \\Pr[ a \\le X \\le b].\n\\]\nQuestion: why is this true? What “rule” of probability are we using?\nNow, let’s rearrange that expression: \\[\n\\Pr[ a \\le X \\le b] = \\Pr[ X \\le b ] - \\Pr[ X \\le a ].\n\\]\nHow exactly does this help us? We replaced one probability with a sum of two… that seems worse!\n…at least until I tell you (or you remember from previous courses) that for all the “nice” distributions, R makes it very easy to compute probabilities of the form \\(\\Pr[ X \\le a]\\). The function \\[\nF_X(t) = \\Pr[ X \\le t]\n\\] is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \\(X\\).\nWe compute the CDF of the normal in R with pnorm. So, for example, to compute the probability that a standard normal random variable is \\(\\le 0\\), we can write\n\npnorm(0) # Once again, mu, sigma default to 0,1.\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nAside/exercise: You might enjoy spending some time thinking on why it is “obvious” that a normal random variable is less than or equal to its mean with probability one half. Remember (look at the density function above, or just look at our plots) that the normal density is symmetric about the mean \\(\\mu\\). If you’re feeling up to it (warning: calculus ahead!), you can try computing the appropriate integrals to show that under the normal, \\(\\Pr[ X \\le \\mu ] = \\Pr[ X &gt; \\mu ] = 1/2\\).\nSo suppose that we want to compute the probability that a standard normal random variable is less or equal to 1. This would be\n\npnorm(1) # again, recall the default behavior.\n\n[1] 0.8413447\n\n\nAnd to compute the probability that we are within one standard deviation of the mean, we need to compute \\[\n\\Pr[ -1 \\le X \\le 1] = \\Pr[ X \\le 1 ] - \\Pr[ X \\le -1 ] = \\texttt{ pnorm(1) - pnorm(-1) }\n\\]\nThat is,\n\npnorm(1) - pnorm(-1)\n\n[1] 0.6826895\n\n\nwhich matches our 0.68-.9545-0.997 rule so far. Let’s check the other two.\n\npnorm(2) - pnorm(-2)\n\n[1] 0.9544997\n\n\n\npnorm(3) - pnorm(-3)\n\n[1] 0.9973002\n\n\nBy the way, if you’ve seen this bell-shaped curve before in your classes, you probably associate it with Z-scores and the magic number 1.96.\nWe’ll see a bit of that this semester, but for the most part, we will use Monte Carlo simulation to do testing.\nThis is a different approach to statistics that lets us avoid worrying so much about Z-tables and 1.96 and all that, but in the interest of full disclosure: really most of the basic parts of R are just fancy Z-tables. So R does the annoying work for us!\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Recap: RVs in R (so far)\nSo far, we have seen three functions for working with different distributions.\nFor the normal, we have rnorm, dnorm and pnorm, corresponding to random variable generation, the density function and cumulative distribution function (CDF), respectively.\nOther RVs have similar patterns. For example, with the geometric random variable, we have rgeom, dgeom and pgeom, which work analogously to the normal case.\nThere is one more of these functions yet to come, but we aren’t quite ready to introduce it.\n\n\n3.5.3 Aside: Expectation for continuous random variables\nPreviously, we defined the expectation of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) to be \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\sum_k k \\Pr[ X = k ],\n\\] with the summand \\(k\\) ranging over all allowable values of \\(X\\).\nWhen \\(X\\) is continuous, the sum doesn’t make sense, so how should we define the expectation?\nWell, just change the sum to an integral! After all, the integral sign is just a fancy S for “sum” (okay, it’s for the Latin word “summa” or something along those lines, but close enough!).\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\int_\\Omega t f(t) dt,\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(t)\\) is the density of \\(X\\) and \\(\\Omega\\) is the support.\nExercise: Let’s flex those calculus muscles! Check that the mean of a normal with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is indeed \\(\\mu\\). That is, check that \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{ t }{ \\sqrt{ 2\\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left\\{ \\frac{ -(t-\\mu)^2 }{ 2\\sigma^2 } \\right\\} dt = \\mu.\n\\]\nHint: Make the substitution \\(u=t-\\mu\\) and use the facts that\n\n\\(f(t) = e^{-(t-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}/\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}\\) integrates to \\(1\\) (because it is a probability density), and\n\\(g(u) = u \\exp\\{ -u^2/2\\sigma^2 \\}\\) is symmetric about zero (and thus integrates to zero).\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Uniform\nThe uniform distribution is a continuous random variable whose density is constant on its outcome space.\nThat is, for continuous set \\(\\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\), the density is identically \\(f(t) = c\\).\nRemember that our probability has to sum to 1, but since we have a continuous support, this sum becomes an integral:\n\\[\n\\int_{\\Omega} f(t) dt = \\int_{\\Omega} c dt = c \\int_{\\Omega} 1 dt.\n\\]\nSo to make the probability integrate to \\(1\\), we need \\(c = \\int_{\\Omega} 1 dt\\).\nMost commonly, we take \\(\\Omega = [0,1]\\), and call the resulting random variable “uniform 0-1”, written \\(\\operatorname{Unif(0,1)}\\).\nThe density function of \\(\\operatorname{Unif(0,1)}\\) is then given by \\[\nf(t) = \\begin{cases}\n  1 &\\mbox{ if } 0 \\le t \\le 1 \\\\\n  0 &\\mbox{ otherwise. } \\end{cases}\n\\]\nExercise: check that this indeed integrates to \\(1\\), i.e., that it is a valid probability density. The support is \\([0,1]\\), so we need to check that \\(\\int_0^1 1 dt = 1\\).\nThe most common application of uniform random variables is in simulations when we need to make a random decision.\nFor example, suppose we didn’t have the Bernoulli distribution available to us for some reason, but we still wanted to generate random coin flips.\nTo generate a \\(\\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)\\) random variable, we could first draw a uniform random variable \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(0,1)\\) and then output \\(1\\) (or “heads” or “true”) if \\(U \\le p\\) and out put \\(0\\) (or “tails” or “false”) otherwise.\n\n\n3.5.5 Exponential\nLet’s look at one more continuous random variable.\nThe exponential distribution is most commonly used to model “waiting times”, like how long until the bus arrives.\nIn many ways, the exponential distribution is like the continuous version of the geometric distribution.\nLike geometric random variables, the exponential distribution is non-negative and is controlled by a single parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), called the rate (because larger \\(\\lambda\\) means less time before the event, hence more events per unit time, i.e., a higher rate of events).\nThe density is given by \\[\nf(t  \\lambda ) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\lambda \\exp\\{ - \\lambda t \\} &\\mbox{ if } t \\ge 0 \\\\\n  0 &\\mbox{ otherwise. }\n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\nExercise: check that this defines a probability distribution by checking that for any \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), (1) \\(f(t \\lambda) \\ge 0\\) and (2) \\(\\int_0^\\infty f(t \\lambda) dt = 1\\).\nLet’s plot this density as a function of \\(t\\) for \\(\\lambda = 1\\).\n\nx &lt;- seq(0, 10, 0.1)\nf &lt;- dexp(x, rate = 1)\ndf_exp &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = x, \"density\" = f)\npp &lt;- ggplot(df_exp, aes(x = x, y = density)) +\n  geom_line(size = 2)\npp\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the density, we see that most of the probability is near zero.\nRoughly, it looks like the vast majority of the time, \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Exp}(1)\\) should be less than 5. Let’s check!\n\ndata &lt;- rexp(n = 1e6, rate = 1) # rexp to generate random exponentials.\nsum(data &lt; 5) / length(data) # something like 99% of the generated points should be below 5.\n\n[1] 0.993314\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.6 Bonus: Building Bigger Models\nThere are plenty more named distributions out there. See here.\nIndeed, we can make all sorts of distributions– ultimately we just need to specify a support and a density or mass function, depending on whether we want a discrete or continuous variable.\nMore often, though, the processes out in the world that we want to model require that we build more complicated models from simple ones.\n\n\n3.5.7 Social network models\nSeveral professors in the statistics department study networks. A common example of these are social networks (e.g., Facebook and twitter).\nThese data usually take the form of a list specifying who is friends with whom.\nIn most models for social networks, each pair of people \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) become friends, independently, with some probability \\(p_{ij}\\).\nOften, these probabilities depend on other random variables.\n\nFor example, we might have a (random) number for every person that describes how much that person likes sports, and pairs of people who both have a high “sports score” are more likely to be friends (i.e., \\(p_{ij}\\) is higher).\n\nIn this way, we combine different elementary random variables (e.g., Bernoullis and normals) to yield more complicated distributions (say, a probability distribution over “possible social networks”).\nHaving obtained a network from Twitter or Facebook data, we apply all sorts of different functions to it that describe the network’s structure (e.g., compute shortest paths or eigenvectors, if you know what those are).\nIt is really difficult to do the math out exactly to determine analytically how these different functions behave.\nInstead, we often appeal to Monte Carlo methods, which we will discuss in the next lecture.\n\n\n3.5.8 Binomial asset pricing model\nAnother way to create new random variables is to take a function of another random variable. This is what happens in the pricing of “options” in finance.\nSuppose that \\(X\\) is the price of stock XYZ one month from today.\nAn “option” pays you \\(f(X)\\) on that day for some function \\(f\\).\nFor example, suppose stock XYZ costs $120 today and the function is\n\\[\nf(X)= \\begin{cases} 120−X &\\mbox{ if } X&lt;120 \\\\\n    0 &\\mbox{ otherwise. } \\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis is often referred to as a put option. It is essentially giving you the option to purchase the stock in one month and sell it at today’s price.\n\nIf the price goes up, you would not use that option and you would make zero (but not lose any additional money, such as the cost of buying the option in the first place).\nOtherwise, you would make \\(120−X\\).\nIn effect, you are betting that the price will go down.\n\nSuppose you are a bank and someone wants to purchase this put option. You need to determine the price.\nWhat would be the fair price to charge them?\nTo make a good guess, we need a model for the asset price \\(X\\).\nOnce we have such a model, we can derive analytical expressions for \\(f(X)\\) or use Monte Carlo methods, which we will discuss soon.\nOne of the simplest models for \\(X\\) is the Binomial Asset Pricing Model, which says that at every time step (e.g., every minute), the price goes up by one penny with probability \\(p\\), or down by one penny with probability \\(1−p\\).\nIn this example, both \\(X\\) and \\(f(X)\\) are random variables.\nQuestion: The Binomial Asset Pricing Model is a very simple model, especially given how complicated the stock market is. Can you think of any possible problems with the model?\n\n\n3.5.9 Election models\nWill the Democratic (D) or Republican (R) presidential candidate win Wisconsin in 20xx?\nWhat is the distribution of this random variable \\(W\\), where \\(W=−1\\) if D and \\(W=1\\) if R?\nWhat about neighboring Michigan \\(M \\in \\{-1,1\\}\\)?\nWisconsin and Michigan are not so different, so if we find out that the Republican candidate won Michigan (i.e., we learn about \\(M\\)), then that certainly tells us something about \\(W\\).\nThat is to say, \\(W\\) and \\(M\\) are not independent.\nWhat if we wanted to model both Wisconsin and Michigan together?\nWe usually write this as a pair \\((W,M)\\).\nOne thing you could do is model the proportion of votes for D vs R in Wisconsin (ignoring third parties) as normally distributed.\n\nPerhaps you consider this to be \\(W_p \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(1/2,.05)\\).\nThen, \\(W\\) is 1 if \\(W_p&gt;.5\\) and \\(W=−1\\) if \\(W_p&lt;.5\\).\n\nThis helps because we can do the same thing for \\(M\\), based on and \\(M_p\\).\nWe can model \\((W_p,M_p)\\) as being correlated via the multivariate normal.\nTo simulate these, you need to specify both the mean, which is now a two-dimensional “vector” and a covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}\\).\nThe diagonal of the matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) specifies the variances of \\(W_p\\) and \\(M_p\\) respectively, and the off-diagonal \\(\\Sigma_{1,2}\\) specifies the covariance between \\(W_p\\) and \\(M_p\\).\nIf you haven’t heard of covariance before, think of it like a measure of how closely two variables track one another, similar to correlation.\n\nWhen the covariance is large and positive, the two variables tend to track one another.\nIf the covariance is large and negative, the two variables are inversely related to one another.\n\nLet’s try simulating some election results.\n\nmu &lt;- c(.5, .5) # Vector of means both W_p and M_p are mean 1/2.\nCovMx &lt;- matrix(c(.05^2, .04^2, .04^2, .05^2), nrow = 2) # Make a two-by-two symmetric matrix.\nCovMx\n\n       [,1]   [,2]\n[1,] 0.0025 0.0016\n[2,] 0.0016 0.0025\n\n\n\nlibrary(MASS) # This library includes a multivariate normal\n\nWarning: package 'MASS' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nWpMp &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 2000, mu = mu, Sigma = CovMx) # mvrnorm is the multivariate version of rnorm.\nplot(WpMp, xlab = \"Wisconsin proportion\", ylab = \"Michigan proportion\")\nlines(c(.5, .5), c(-10, 10), col = \"red\")\nlines(c(-10, 10), c(.5, .5), col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nEach point in this plot corresponds to one simulated election.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat region of this plot corresponds to \\(W=−1\\) and \\(M=+1\\)?\nDoes it make sense that there are fewer points in the top left compared to the top right?\nAre Michigan and Wisconsin positively or negatively correlated (based on this plot, anyway)?\n\n\n\n3.5.10 Review:\nIn these notes we covered:\n\nThe basic rules of probability: outcome spaces, events\nthe concept of a random variable\nFamilies of discrete random variables: Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, Poisson and uniform\nFamilies of continuous random variables: Gaussian (normal), exponential and uniform\nThe concept of expected value\nPMF, PDF and CDF\ncomputing probabilities\nsome applications of random variables"

A common technique for this is “random digit dialing”, which is exactly what it sounds like.\nThis poll reached 806 registered voters in Wisconsin. After a significant amount of statistical work, the pollsters reported that\n\n48% of likely voters would choose Biden\n43% would vote for Trump\n2% for Jorgensen, and\n7% remained undecided.\n\nIn order to reach those 806 participants, many more numbers need to be dialed. In this poll, the response rate was 4.3%. If you read the methodology report, you’ll see that in fact over 100,000 numbers had to be dialed to get these 806 respondents. The vast majority of those 100,000 calls were never picked up. Among those who did pick up, 806 were registered voters and agreed to participate in the survey, but another were 1113 refused to participate (or hung up).\nIn the actual election,\n\nBiden received 49.45% of votes cast in Wisconsin and\nTrump received 48.82%.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow does this compare with the predicted vote shares of 48% for Biden and 43% for Trump?\nHow might we explain the discrepancies?”\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Testing\nYou have no doubt heard that “correlation does not imply causation”. Well, this is true.\n\nIce cream consumption is correlated with drowning, but we don’t think that ice cream causes drowning.\nHospitals are full of sick people, but we don’t think that hospitals cause sickness.\n\nNonetheless, to paraphrase a relevant comic, causality often does give awfully strong hints.\n\n\n\nCredit: Randall Munroe, XKCD (https://xkcd.com/552)\n\n\nExample: On November 16, 2020 Moderna released results from their phase 3 clinical trial for their COVID-19 vaccine.\nThere were approximately 30,000 people in the trial, split (approximately) evenly between treatment (got the vaccine) and control (got a placebo).\n\nIn total, there were 95 cases of COVID-19 among the participants; 90 among the placebo group and 5 among the treated group.\nOf the 95 cases, 11 were severe cases, all in the placebo group.\n\nIn this study, vaccination is correlated with reduced risk of infection.\n\nDoes this mean that the vaccination causally reduced COVID-19 infection? Why or why not?\nHow do we know that we aren’t fooling ourselves when we say that the Moderna vaccine is effective?\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Estimation\nThe news is perpetually full of stories about different economic indicators and how they are changing over time.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is meant to measure the change over time in prices of consumer goods and services.\nMost surveys (e.g., public opinion or election surveys) are reported with a +/- 3% “confidence interval” or “sampling error”.\n\nWhat is that all about?\nExample: In the Wisconsin poll discussed above, the margin of error was reported to be +/- 4.3%.\nRecall that the pollsters predicted 48% of likely voters would choose Biden and 43% Trump, while the actual outcome was 49.45% for Biden and 48.82% for Trump.\n\nIs this outcome within the stated margin of error?\nMore generally, what does it mean to give a confidence interval for a quantity of interest?”\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Prediction\nInvesting successfully (in real estate, stocks, etc) requires that we be able to predict the future behavior of an asset based on what we know about it currently.\n\nBased on the size of a house, its proximity to schools or infrastructure, walkability of its neighborhood, etc., we might hope to predict its “true” price.\nMany psychology and sociology studies aim to predict future student outcomes based on performance on a standardized test\n\nIn these kinds of problems, our goal is to predict an outcome or response (e.g., house price) based on one or more predictors (e.g., square footage of the house).\nMost of machine learning is concerned with prediction problems. For example, labeling an image according to whether or not it contains a cat can be stated as a prediction problem.\nExample: this plot shows different people’s incomes (in tens of thousands of dollars per year) as a function of their years of education.\n\n\n\nEducation by income\n\n\nIt certainly looks like more years of education correlate with higher income.\nQuestion: Suppose I tell you that someone has 18 years of education. What would you predict their income to be?\n\n\n2.5.5 Observational/exploratory data analysis\nSuppose that a colleague or client gives you a data set that looks like this:\n\nWhat would you do? There is clearly some kind of a cluster structure present here.\nThe goal of exploratory data analysis is to identify interesting structures in our data that might warrant further study.\nExample: In my own research, I (Keith) collaborate a lot with neuroscientists, who are interested in identifying functional subnetworks of the brain. These are groups of neurons that work together, typically because they are associated with the same activity (e.g., attention, motion, speech).\nThis is an example of clustering, in which our goal is to group data points in a sensible way, without necessarily saying ahead of time what those groups mean\nOftentimes, we obtain observational data. That is, data that does not come from a carefully-designed experiment.\nExample: Much data in the modern age of “big data” is collected by scraping the web or collected in other “messy” ways.\n\nScraping data from a social media site such as Twitter.\nMeasuring the socioeconomic status of people in different zip codes\n\nThere are lots of interesting scientific questions we might like to ask about such a data set, but because this data isn’t the result of a carefully-controlled experiment, we are often much more limited in what we can say."

    "text": "2.6 World, Data, Model (hat tip to Karl Rohe)\nUnless you subscribe to some rather outlandish philosophical beliefs (see, e.g., here), there is a world out there, which we would like to learn about.\nTo figure things out about the world, we take measurements. That is to say, we collect data. These data describe the world, but it remains to build a model that explains how these data came to be.\nThe process of inference is how we use a specific set of data to guide our beliefs about the world.\nAs a simple example, consider human height. What is the average adult human height?\nThis is a question about the world. In fact, we could compute the average adult human height exactly if we could go out and measure the height of every adult human.\n\nOf course this would be a complicated and expensive process.\nInstead, we could just measure the heights of a few adult humans (say, a few thousand).\n\nOf course, this small collection of humans would need to be chosen randomly and in such a way that they would be representative of the population as a whole, but let’s ignore that concern until later in the course.\nThe few thousand heights that we measure would constitute our data– measurements that were taken out there in the world.\nHere is a simulation of what that data might look like with a sample of size 2000.\n\n# heights.R contains code for generating our synthetic data set.\nsource('r_scripts/heights.R');\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\npp &lt;- ggplot( df_heights, aes(x=heights ) );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill=\"grey\", color=\"black\", binwidth=2, );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=mean(heights), color=\"black\", linetype='f8', linewidth=1);\npp\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical dashed line indicates the mean of these 2000 sampled heights.\nBecause this is a random sample (and because heights vary due to factors like nutrition and genetics), this sample mean need not be equal to the population mean (i.e., the true average adult human height).\nInstead, the heights in our sample (and their mean) will vary randomly about the population average height. We use a statistical model (i.e., probability theory) to describe this variation.\nA common choice for modeling random variation like this is the normal distribution (in the coming lectures we will see plenty of other distributions).\nWe assume that our data are generated by a normal distribution with some mean \\(\\mu\\) (i.e., the average height) and some standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). We call these parameters of the model.\nEstimating the population average height then reduces to estimating the “true” value of the parameter \\(\\mu\\) based on the data.\nThis step of using our data to determine something about our model is called inference. In this case, our goal is to estimate the value of the model parameter \\(\\mu\\), which will in turn be our estimate of the average adult human height."

    "text": "2.7 All models are wrong, but some are useful\nAn important point in our human height example above was our assumption that heights are normally distributed. In practice, modeling assumptions like these are never strictly true.\nOur model is just that– a model of the world; a set of simplifying assumptions that we hope are at least a good approximation to the truth.\nThink of your physics courses, where we assume that things happen in a frictionless void and use Newtonian mechanics instead of quantum mechanics.\nWe make assumptions like these because they often make the math easier while still being a good approximation to reality.\nIn our example above, the normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) says that with some (perhaps very small) probability, we might observe a negative number.\nIf we model human heights as being normally distributed, our model predicts that we should, on occasion, meet people who have negative height.\n\nWhy might that be a problem?\nWhy might it be okay to still use this model anyway?\n\nLet’s push ahead and “fit” a normal to our data. We’ll have lots to say about this later. For now, think of this as choosing, out of all the possible normal distributions, the one that “best agrees”” with our data.\n\n# The dataframe df_normal contains a column of x-values in the same range as our synthetic data.\n# df_normal$y contains the normal pdf with mean and standard deviation fit to our synthetic data,\n# evaluated at these x-values.\npp &lt;- pp + geom_line( aes(x=df_normal$x, y=df_normal$y), size=1, color='red' );\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\npp\n\n\n\n\nHuh. Our data seems to be a bit “flatter” than the normal distribution would predict.\nPerhaps this is just due to random fluctuation, but in fact there is a very simple reason for this: We didn’t tell you about it, but this sample includes both males and females.\nLet’s plot the same histogram, but this time, let’s break out the heights according to sex.\n\npp &lt;- ggplot( df_heights, aes(x=heights, color=sex, fill=sex ) );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_histogram( aes(y=..density..), position=\"identity\", alpha=0.5, binwidth=2);\npp\n\n\n\n\nHuman heights are bimodal– female heights are approximately normal about some mean, and male heights are approximately normal about another.\nWe can fit a normal to each of these separately and we see that our model agrees with the data much better.\n\n# df_bimodal$x contains x values that agree with the range of our height data.\n# df_bimodal$density is the density of a normal distribution, fit to the male or female heights,\n#        evaluated at these x-values.\n# df_bimodal$sex encodes male/female\\n\",\npp &lt;- pp + geom_line(data=df_bimodal, aes(x=x, y=density, color=sex), size=2, alpha=0.5);\npp\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good (albeit simple) illustration of the kind of iterative workflow that we typically use in data science.\n\nWe obtain our data, fit a model to it, and then we examine the shortcomings of that model.\nAfter some thought, it becomes clear how to improve our model.\nWe implement those changes (in this case, we incorporated the variable sex into our model), and examine our findings again.\n\nTypically, we repeat this cycle several times before reaching a conclusion that we are confident in."

    "text": "4.2 Recap: RVs events and independence.\nWhen working with random variables, we start with a set of possible outcomes, usually denoted \\(\\Omega\\).\nA subset \\(E \\subseteq \\Omega\\) of the outcome space is called an event.\nA probability is a function that maps events to numbers, with the properties that\n\n\\(\\Pr[ E ] \\in [0,1]\\) for all events \\(E\\)\n\\(\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = 1\\)\nFor \\(E_1,E_2 \\in \\Omega\\) with \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\), \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cup E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] + \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\)\n\nNote: If \\(\\Pr[E_1 \\cap E_2]=\\emptyset\\), we say that \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are mutually exclusive (or disjoint)\nWe say that two events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are independent if \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\). Note that it is very common to write \\(\\Pr[ E_1, E_2]\\) to mean \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ]\\). We usually read that as “the probability of events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\)” or “the probability that \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) occur”.\nTwo random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if for all sets \\(S_1,S_2\\), we have \\(\\Pr[ X \\in S_1,~ Y \\in S_2 ] = \\Pr[ X \\in S_1 ] \\Pr[ Y \\in S_2 ]\\).\nRoughly speaking, two random variables are independent if learning information about one of them doesn’t tell you anything about the other.\n\nFor example, if each of us flips a coin, it is reasonable to model them as being independent.\nLearning whether my coin landed heads or tails doesn’t tell us anything about your coin.\n\n\n4.2.1 Example: dice and coins\nSuppose that you roll a die and I flip a coin. Let \\(D\\) denote the (random) outcome of the die roll, and let \\(C\\) denote the (random) outcome of the coin flip. So \\(D \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and \\(C \\in \\{H,T\\}\\). Suppose that for all \\(d \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and all \\(c \\in \\{H,T\\}\\), \\(\\Pr[ D=d, C=c ] = 1/12\\).\nQuestion: Verify that the random variables \\(D\\) and \\(C\\) are independent, or at least check that it’s true for two particular events \\(E_1 \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and \\(E_2 \\subseteq \\{H,T\\}\\).\n\n\n4.2.2 Example: more dice\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. Consider the following two events: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE_1 &= \\{ \\text{The die lands on an even number} \\} \\\\\nE_2 &= \\{ \\text{The die lands showing 3} \\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAre these two events independent? Our intuitive definition of independence is that learning about one event shouldn’t change the probability of the other event. These two events surely fail that test: if I tell you that the die landed on an even number, then it’s certainly impossible that it landed showing a 3, since 3 isn’t even.\nLet’s verify this intuition by checking that these two events fail the formal definition of independence. That is, let’s verify that \\[\n\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] \\neq \\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ].\n\\]\nThere are six sides on our die, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and three of those sides are even numbers, so \\(\\Pr[ E_1 ] = 1/2\\).\nThe probability that the die lands showing 3 is exactly \\(\\Pr[ E_2 ] = 1/6\\).\nPutting these together, \\(\\Pr[E_1] \\Pr[E_2] = 1/12\\).\nOn the other hand, let’s consider \\(E_1 \\cap E_2\\). This is the event that the die lands showing an even number and it lands showing three. These two events cannot both happen!\nThat means that \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\). That is, the intersection of these two events is the empty set. The laws of probability require that \\(\\Pr[ \\emptyset ] = 0\\) (Aside: why? Hint: \\(\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = 1\\) and \\(\\emptyset \\cap \\Omega = \\emptyset\\); now use the fact that the probability of the union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities).\nSo we have \\[\n\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] = 0 \\neq \\frac{1}{12} =\\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ].\n\\]\nOur two events are indeed not independent.\nImportant note: it’s not always so obvious that two events are independent! Any probability textbook will have a collection of good examples of less intuitive independent and dependent events."

This is standard notation, but it’s sometimes a source of confusion to beginner students, so be careful!\nA basic property of expectation is that it is linear. For any constants (i.e., non-random) \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\[\n\\mathbb{E} (a X + b) = a \\mathbb{E} X + b.\n\\] If \\(X,Y\\) are random variables, then \\[\n\\mathbb{E}( X + Y) = \\mathbb{E} X + \\mathbb{E} Y.\n\\]\nThis linearity of expectation property may look/sound a bit weird, but this isn’t the first time you’ve seen it– derivatives and integrals are linear, too! For example, \\[\n(a ~f(t) + b ~g(t))' = a ~ f'(t) + b ~g'(t)\n\\]\nand \\[\n\\int(a f(t) + b g(t)) dt = a \\int f(t) dt + b \\int g(t) dt\n\\]\nBecause expected value is simply an integral (or summation), the linearity of expectation follows directly from the definition.\nExercise: prove that \\(\\mathbb{E} (a X + b) = a \\mathbb{E} X + b\\) for discrete r.v. \\(X\\).\nExercise: prove that \\(\\mathbb{E}( X + Y) = \\mathbb{E} X + \\mathbb{E} Y\\) for discrete \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nExercise: Use the linearity of expectation to prove that \\(\\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2 = \\mathbb{E} X^2 - \\mathbb{E}^2 X\\).

Is the variance of the sum the sum of the variances?\nWell, sadly, not always. To see why this isn’t always true, consider RVs \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n&= \\mathbb{E}[ X + Y - \\mathbb{E}(X + Y) ]^2 \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E} X) + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) ]^2,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere the second equality follows from applying linear of expectation to write \\(\\mathbb{E}(X+Y) = \\mathbb{E}X + \\mathbb{E}Y\\).\nNow, let’s expand the square in the expectation. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n&=\n\\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E} X) + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) ]^2 \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2 + 2(X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)\n              + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2 ] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2 + 2 \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) + \\mathbb{E} (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the last equality is just using the linearity of expectation.\nNow, the first and last terms there are the variances of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[\n\\operatorname{Var} X = \\mathbb{E}(X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2,~~~\n\\operatorname{Var} Y = \\mathbb{E}(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2.\n\\] So \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n= \\operatorname{Var} X + 2 \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)\n  + \\operatorname{Var} Y.\n\\]\nSo what’s up with that middle term? This term might be familiar to you– it is (two times) the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), often written \\[\n\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)\n= \\mathbb{E}( X - \\mathbb{E}X)( Y - \\mathbb{E} Y).\n\\]\nNow, if \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\), then \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y) = \\operatorname{Var} X + \\operatorname{Var} Y.\n\\]\nBut when does \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\)?\nWell, one sufficient condition is that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be independent. That is, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables, then \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\).\nNote: We will skip the proof that independence of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) implies \\(Cov(X,Y)=0\\), but you can find this proof in many places online."

You can see from the definition that \\(Y\\) is most definitely dependent on \\(X\\). If, for example, you know that \\(x=.5\\), then you know that \\(y=.5^2=.25\\). A proof that the covariance is zero is going to be difficult, but we can simulate some data to help us be confident that the claim is true.\n\nx &lt;- runif(10000, -1, 1)\ny &lt;- x^2\n\ncov(x,y)\n\n[1] 0.0003628265\n\n\nThe covariance of this sample of 10,000 observations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is very close to 0 (probably a little below or a little above due to randomness). The sample correlation is\n\ncor(x,y)\n\n[1] 0.002149034\n\n\nAgain - this is a number that is very close to zero.\n\n\n4.5.2 Example: sums of independent normals\nLet’s consider two independent normals: \\[\nX_1 \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(1,1)\n~\\text{ and }~\nX_2 \\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(2,2).\n\\]\nSince \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are independent,\n\nthe variance of their sum should be the sum of their variances, and\ntheir correlation should be zero\n\nLet’s check both of those facts in simulation. We’ll generate lots of copies of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), and then we’ll compute their\n\n(sample) variances separately,\n(sample) variance of their sum, and\n(sample) correlation\n\nOf course, all three of these quantities will be estimated from samples. The law of large numbers tells us that these quantities computed on our data will be close to the truth, but not necessarily precisely equal to the truth.\nOkay, let’s generate data.\n\nM &lt;- 1e5; # Generate 100K Monte Carlo samples\nX1 &lt;- rnorm( n=M, mean=1, sd=sqrt(1) );\nX2 &lt;- rnorm( n=M, mean=2, sd=sqrt(2) );\n\n# Compute the (sample) variances of the copies of X1 and X2.\nv1 &lt;- var(X1);\nv2 &lt;- var(X2);\n\n# v1 should be close to 1=Var X_1, v2 close to 2=Var X_2.\nc( v1, v2 )\n\n[1] 0.9964867 2.0028233\n\n\nAnd let’s check that these two independent variables have covariance (approximately) zero.\n\n# cor( x, y) computes the (sample) covariance between\n# the entries of vectors x and y.\n# See ?cor for details.\ncor( X1, X2 );\n\n[1] 0.006530369\n\n\nAgain, those sample-based quantities will never be precisely equal to 1, 2, and 0, but they will be very close!\nFinally, let’s check that the variance of the sum \\(X_1 + X_2\\) is the sum of variances, as it should be if the RVs are independent. So we should see \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_1 + X_2)\n= \\operatorname{Var} X_1 + \\operatorname{Var} X_2\n= 1 + 2 = 3.\n\\]\nOkay, let’s check.\n\nvar(X1 + X2)\n\n[1] 3.017761\n\n\nAs we predicted!\n\n\n4.5.3 Example: multivariate normal\nRemember that the multivariate normal is a way of generating multiple normal random variables that are correlated with one another.\nHere’s our code from our example modeling the voter shares in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nmu &lt;- c(.5,.5); # Vector of means; both W_p and M_p are mean 1/2.\nCovMx &lt;- matrix( c(.05^2,.04^2,.04^2,.05^2), nrow = 2); # Make a two-by-two symmetric matrix.\nCovMx;\n\n       [,1]   [,2]\n[1,] 0.0025 0.0016\n[2,] 0.0016 0.0025\n\n\nThe code above generates a multivariate normal with two entries. Both will have means \\(0.5\\), encoded in the vector mu.\nThe variances and covariance between the two normals is encoded by CovMx. It encodes a matrix (fancy word for an array of numbers), which looks like \\[\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.05^2 & 0.04^2 \\\\\n0.04^2 & 0.05^2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] That \\(0.4^2\\) in the off-diagonal entries is the covariance of the two normals.\nSo this will generate two normal random variables, both having mean \\(0.5\\), and variance \\(0.05^2\\), but these two normals will be correlated, with covariance \\(0.04^2\\).\nLet’s have a look:\n\nlibrary(MASS); # This library includes a multivariate normal\nWpMp = mvrnorm(n=2000, mu=mu, Sigma=CovMx); #mvrnorm is the multivariate version of rnorm.\nplot(WpMp, xlab = \"Wisconsin proportion\", ylab = \"Michigan proportion\");\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that the Wisconsin and Michigan voter shares are correlated– we can see it in the plot!\nBut just to be sure:\n\n# WpMp is an array with two columns and 500 rows.\n# If we call cov on it directly, we get something shaped\n# like our covariance matrix.\ncov(WpMp )\n\n            [,1]        [,2]\n[1,] 0.002434066 0.001654258\n[2,] 0.001654258 0.002638478\n\n\nThe diagonal entries are the (sample) variances computed along the columns. The off-diagonal entries (note that they are both the same) tell us the (sample) covariance. Unsurprisingly, the off-diagonal is close to the true covariance \\(0.0016\\).\nAlso worth noting is the fact that the on-diagonal entries are (approximately) 0.025. The on-diagonal entries are computing covariances of our two columns of data with themselves. That is, these are computing something like \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,X)\\).\nWhat is a random variable’s covariance with itself? Let’s plug in the definition: \\[\n\\operatorname{Cov}(X,X)\n= \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)(X - \\mathbb{E} X)\n= \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2\n\\]\nHey, that’s the variance! So \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,X) = \\operatorname{Var} X\\)."

    "text": "4.6 How reasonable is independence?\nIn most applications, it is pretty standard that we assume that our data are drawn independently and identically distributed according to some distribution. We say “i.i.d.”. For example, if \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) are all continuous uniform random variables between 0 and 1, we would say \\[\nX_i \\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\text{Uniform}(0,1), \\text{ for } i=1,\\ldots, n\n\\]\nThis notation is common to denote iid random variables.\nAs another example, when we perform regression (as you did in STAT240, and which we’ll revisit in more detail later this semester), we imagine that the observations (i.e., predictor-response pairs) \\((X_1,Y_1),(X_2,Y_2),\\dots,(X_n,Y_n)\\) are independent.\nMost standard testing procedures (e.g., the t-test) assume that data are drawn i.i.d.\nHow reasonable are these assumptions?\nWell, of course, in the end, it depends on where the data comes from! We have to draw on what we know about the data, either from our own knowledge or from that of our clients, to assess what assumptions are and aren’t reasonable.\nLike most modeling assumptions, we usually acknowledge that independence may not be exactly true, but it’s often a good approximation to the truth!\nOf course, we have to be careful.\nExample: suppose we are modeling the value of a stock over time. We model the stock’s price on days 1, 2, 3, etc as \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots\\). What is wrong with modeling these prices as being independent of one another? Why might it still be a reasonable modeling assumption?\nWhat if instead we look at the change in stock price from day to day? For example, let \\(Y_i = X_{i+1}-X_{i}\\). In other words, \\(X_{i+1}=X_i+Y_i\\). Would it be more reasonable to assume that the \\(Y_i\\)’s are independent?\nWhat if instead of considering a stock’s returns on one day after another, we look at a change in stock price on one day, then at the change 10 days from that, and 10 days from that, and so on? Surely there is still dependence, but a longer time lag between observations might make us more willing to accept that our observations are close to independent (or at least have much smaller covariance!).\nNote: Tobler’s first law of geography states ‘Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.’ Does that ring true in this context?\nExample: suppose we randomly sample 1000 UW-Madison students to participate in a survey, and record their responses as \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_{1000}\\). What might be the problem with modeling these responses as being independent? Why might be still be a reasonable modeling assumption?"

What is the probability that the die lands showing 2?\nNow, suppose that I don’t tell you the number on the die, but I do tell you that the die landed on an even number (i.e., one of 2, 4 or 6). Now what is the probability that the die is showing 2?\nWe can work out the probabilities by simply counting possible outcomes. Are the probabilities the same?\nExample: disease screening\nHere’s a more real-world (and more consequential example): suppose we are screening for a rare disease. A patient takes the screening test, and tests positive. What is the probability that the patient has the disease, given that they have tested positive for it?\nWe will need to establish the rules of conditional probability before we can tackle a problem such as this.\n\n4.7.1 Introducing conditional probability\nThese kinds of questions, in which we want to ask about the probability of an event given that something else has happened, require that we be able to define a “new kind” of probability, called conditional probability.\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two events.\n\nExample: \\(A\\) could be the event that a die lands showing 2 and \\(B\\) is the event that the die landed on an even number.\nExample: \\(A\\) could be the event that our patient has a disease and \\(B\\) is the event that the patient tests positive on a screening test.\n\nProvided that \\(\\Pr[ B ] &gt; 0\\), we define the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), written \\(\\Pr[ A \\mid B]\\), according to \\[\n\\Pr[ A \\mid B ] = \\frac{ \\Pr[ A \\cap B ] }{ \\Pr[ B ] }.\n\\] Note that if \\(\\Pr[B] = 0\\), then the ratio on the right-hand side is not defined, hence why we demanded that \\(\\Pr[B] &gt; 0\\). Later in your career, you’ll see that we can actually define conditional probability in a sensible way even if \\(\\Pr[B] = 0\\), but that’s a matter for a later class.\n\n\n\nVenn diagram illustrating conditional probability\n\n\nLet’s try computing one of these conditional probabilities: what is the probability that the die is showing 2 conditional on the fact that it landed on an even number?\nWell,\n\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] = 1/2\\), because there are three even numbers on the die, and all six numbers are equally likely: \\(3/6 = 1/2\\).\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\cap \\text{even} ] = \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 }]\\), since \\(2\\) is an even number.\n\nSo the conditional probability is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\mid \\text{ even }]\n&= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\cap \\text{even} ] }{ \\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] } \\\\\n&= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 }]}\n    { \\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] } \\\\\n&= \\frac{ 1/6 }{ 1/2 } = 1/3.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This makes sense– given that the die lands on an even number, we are choosing from among three outcomes: \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\). The probability that we choose \\(2\\) from among these three possible equally-likely outcomes is \\(1/3\\).\n\n\n4.7.2 Disease screening\nWhat about our disease testing example? What is the probability that our patient has the disease given that they tested positive?\nWell, applying the definition of conditional probability, \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\mid \\text{ positive test }]\n= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\cap \\text{ positive test }] }{ \\Pr[ \\text{positive test} ] }\n\\]\nOkay, but what is \\(\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} ]\\)? I guess it’s just the probability that a random person (with the disease or not) tests positive? For that matter, what is \\(\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\cap \\text{ positive test }]\\)? These can be hard events to assign probabilities to! Luckily, there is a famous equation that often gives us a way forward."
